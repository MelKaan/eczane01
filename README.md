🏥 Automated Pharmacy Monitoring System
This project is a dedicated software solution designed to monitor and manage pharmacy schedules and locations in real-time. It was developed as a personal challenge to solve a real-world problem using robust software engineering principles.

🛠 Tech Stack
Language: C# / .NET (veya hangi dili kullandıysan değiştir)

APIs: Google Maps API / Local Pharmacy Data APIs

Database: SQL Server / SQLite (kullandığını yaz)

💡 Why I Built This (The "Human" Element)
Unlike many AI-generated scripts, this project was built step-by-step to address a specific logistical problem in healthcare. My goal was to create a reliable bridge between real-time data and user-friendly interfaces.

🧩 Challenges I Overcame (Persistence)
During development, I faced several "brick walls" that I had to break through:

API Synchronization: I initially struggled with data delays from external APIs. I solved this by implementing a custom caching logic and optimizing asynchronous calls.

Logic Errors: Handling the shifting schedules of pharmacies required complex conditional logic. I spent weeks debugging and refining these algorithms to ensure 100% accuracy.

Continuous Improvement: This is a living project. I am currently working on adding [X özelliğini ekle, örn: notification system] to further enhance the user experience.
